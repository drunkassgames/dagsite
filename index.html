Here at DrunkAssGames, we believe that it is both good and epic to use your skill and brain whilst one embarks on consuming large amounts of intoxicating liquids. We are sick of playing all the same old games.  We want new games, legendary games, to challenge and elevate our drinking experience. In our games, we shall strive to accomplish this task. Our first game is Death Cup, a unique twist on Quarters, combining the luck of dice with the skill and precision of quarter bouncing.
<br />
<br />
No one drinks and thinks better than a DrunkAssGamer. So if you are feeling distractingly sexy today, take a look around and enjoy what DrunkAssGames has to offer.</td>
